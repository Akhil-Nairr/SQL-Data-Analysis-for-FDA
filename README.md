**Part - 1 SQL Queries:
**
Task 1: Identifying Approval Trends

1. Determine the number of drugs approved each year and provide insights into the yearly
trends.
2. Identify the top three years that got the highest and lowest approvals, in descending and
ascending order, respectively.
3. Explore approval trends over the years based on sponsors.
4. Rank sponsors based on the total number of approvals they received each year between 1939
and 1960.

**Task 2: Segmentation Analysis Based on Drug MarketingStatus
**

1. Group products based on MarketingStatus. Provide meaningful insights into the
segmentation patterns.
2. Calculate the total number of applications for each MarketingStatus year-wise after the year
2010.
3. Identify the top MarketingStatus with the maximum number of applications and analyze its
trend over time.

**Task 3: Analyzing Products
**

1.Categorize Products by dosage form and analyze their distribution.
2. Calculate the total number of approvals for each dosage form and identify the most
successful forms.
3. Investigate yearly trends related to successful forms.

**Task 4: Exploring Therapeutic Classes and Approval Trends
**
1. Analyze drug approvals based on therapeutic evaluation code (TE_Code).
2. Determine the therapeutic evaluation code (TE_Code) with the highest number of Approvals in
each year.


**Part - 2 Power BI Visualizations:
**

i. Visualize the yearly approval trends of drugs. Highlight any significant patterns and/or
fluctuations, if any.

ii. Explore approval trends over the years based on different sponsors. Uncover patterns and
changes in approval rates among sponsors.

iii. Visualize the segmentation of products based on MarketingStatus.

iv. Show the total number of applications for each MarketingStatus. Enable users to filter by
years and MarketingStatus for detailed analysis.

v. Analyze the grouping of drugs by dosage form. Visualize the distribution of approvals across
different forms. Identify the most successful dosage form.

vi. Visualize drug approvals based on therapeutic classes. Identify classes with the highest
number of approvals.
